In Korea,
acupuncture is 
a well-known treatment method. 
Acupuncture involves inserting needles, 
which are longer and thinner than regular needles,
into the body. When inserted at specific points where blood flows, 
it can relax muscles and improve blood circulation, thereby reducing pain. 
My frequent imagination is of a very long needle, about 50cm long, penetrating my skull. 
Through the indentation between the two support points connecting the head and neck, a long needle touches the brain , as if excavating earwax, gently scratching the brain.
