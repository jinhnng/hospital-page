    <pre><p>In Korea, 
there is a famous
treatment called acupuncture.
Acupuncture involves inserting thin 
needles into the body rather than long needles.
When inserted into specific points where blood flows,
it can relax muscles and improve blood circulation, reducing pain.
A common fantasy of mine is using an extremely long needle, about 50cm long, 
to penetrate my skull. Through the fine part between the two supports connecting the head 
and neck, the long needle touches the brain gently, as if digging out earwax, softly scratching the brain.

A friend of mine has become a counselor. It might just be my mood, but I can't shake the feeling that this friend treats me like a client.
I asked her who counselors turn to for support. 
She told me that counselors themselves seek counseling from other counselors in their first few years. 
I recalled the counselor who used to help me in the past.
and the counselor of my counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor's counselor.
We started playing Chinese whispering.
